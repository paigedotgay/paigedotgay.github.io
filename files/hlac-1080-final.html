<h3>Day 1</h3>
<pre>

I have to make dinner and I don't want to do anything fancy, I'm making <b><i>Italian Cereal</i></b>.
<ol>
    <li>Boil Water</li>
    <li>Once the water is boiling, pour in a <b>big bag</b> of <i>small shells</i>, and start browning beef, making sure to chop it small.</li>
    <li>The beef and noodles <i>usually</i> finish at the same time. Strain the noodles, add the beef and a can of Hunt's Petite Diced tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Bowl it up, most people in my house like to add an unhealthy ammount of salt (I'm not saying I don't lol)</li>
</ol>

I didn't eat anything else today so I had two big bowls [about 750]

This is one of my favorite foods, it's easy to cook, and my grandma has been making it for me since I was little, so it's like a comfort food.

<h4>Total: aprox 750cal</h4>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<pre>
I was hanging out with a friend today, we went to Smash Burger.
I got the Spicy Jalapeno Baja (without guacemole, what sick freak mixes guac and mayo??) [626ish],
Regular fries (not Smash Fries, I used to go there a lot and I've had them too much) [366]
A sip of the new coffee shake they have (they don't have the info for this on their website so I'm using coffee ice cream) [15]

The coffee shake was very good, but I didn't have a lot of it.
The burger was ok, but they had a burger I kinda wish I got that was basically all onions (two burger patties w/ onion bun, onion sauce, grilled onions, etc)

<h4>Total: aprox 1007cal</h4>

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<pre>
I stayed up all night last night.
I felt horrible all day.
I basically only wanted to eat things that felt like <i>real food</i>, <i><b>pure food</b></i>,not anything fast-food or fried or out of a carton.
What actually happened was I didn't eat anything until my boyfriend took me out to sushi because that fit my "real food" category (I can see what all the things in sushi are, I guess?)
I can't find the calorie counts for these and all of my counts are low, so I'm going to add 75cal to whatever I can find on the internet that looks most comparable lol
Avocado roll (replacing Shinto roll) [140 +75] Shinto roll is best roll, it says it has yams and I hate yams, but nobody can taste the yams.
Tuna roll (replaing Jenny roll) [184 +75] My new favorite roll, it's basically a california roll, but then they top it with a strip of salmon, and a super thin piece of lemon âœ‹ ðŸ˜© ðŸ‘Œ
Caterpillar roll (replacing P.D. roll) [329 +75] I don't know how I feel about this one, the first bite was gross, but then it has the hit of cilantro and lime that I love so I kept eating it lol
add all of these together than halve them (because sharing with BF) and that's the total
</pre>
<h4>Total: aprox 438cal<br>oof</h4>

<h3>Day 4</h3>
<pre>
Today was D&D day, so there were a lot of snacks right in front of me and I really didn't keep track of much.
I made pasta for everyone [350ish?],
There were kettle cooked jalapeno chips, gonna guess I had 2 servings [260] to be safe,
I had a glass of tea (but it was the super sugary Arizona kind) [140],
We also got a few kinds of cheeses to try, on top of Ritz crackers;
To be safe I'll guess I had like 1/3 a sleeve of crackers [192ish],
We got 3 cheeses, 2 where lame and I didn't care to remember the name because I didn't eat much of them, but I chowed down on the Humboldt-Fog w/ Dill (highly recommend).
This is gonna be more of a guess than a muesurmant or approximation like most of the other things here, but it looks like each oz is 100cal, so maybe around [200?]
</pre>
<h4>TOTAL: aprox 1111cal<br>make a wish!<br><i style="font-size: 60%">i wish i ate less cheese</i></p></h4>

<h3>Day 5</h3>
<pre>
Today was a lazy day at home.
I had a pepperoni hot pocket [320], a sandwich[approx 286] (wheat bread, miracle whip, mustard, turkey, 2 baby pickles), and a bottled strawberry banana fruit smoothie [250]. 
I felt kinda dizzy when I went to the pharmacy, I realized I hadn't eaten much and bought the smoothie.

I don't feel good about any of the things I ate today. I wanna go back to the <i><b>PURE FOOD</b></i> trash lol.
It might be dumb but it felt good.

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<pre>
<ul>
    <li><h3>I'm maybe probably not eating enough.</h3></li>
    My meds supress my hunger pretty hard, so I'll usually only eat once a day, and it ends up being dinner with my family, or if I go eat with a friend (or sometimes not eating).
    Whenever I go see my friend, she talks about how much smaller I'm getting (which I kinda hate, but I can tell she's worried).

    <li><h3>I feel good when I eat better.</h3></li>
    Enough said, I like eating food that's not garbage. I'll definitely try doing this more.
    I've also been trying to drink more water instead of juices/teas (and I don't drink soda because one of my medicines makes it taste like garbage).
</ul>
